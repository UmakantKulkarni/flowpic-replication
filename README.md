# DSC180A Senior Capstone - Viasat VPN Analysis

Our goal is to predict whether a user is streaming video on a VPN by analyzing their network traffic traits such as video signatures, interpacket intervals, packet size, etc. through a machine learning classifier, then repeat the analysis with other noise present on the network. 

Our data collection process uses the network-stats script from Viasat, which will output packet data on a per-second, per-connection basis from any given network interface. This tool was designed to focus more on connection-to-connection data rather than individual packet data. Once running, network-stats will output the time, source, destination, and protocol of the packets sent within any connection, as well as the count, size, time, and direction of each packetâ€™s arrival at the destination. 

## How to run the project

To collect data from `network-stats`, run `python run.py data`, which will load in the desired parameters from `config/data-generation-params.json`

To stop data capturing, `CTRL-C` in your command prompt.
